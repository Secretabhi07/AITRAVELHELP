# Backpacker's Haven

## Project Description
Backpacker's Haven is an interactive web application designed for travel enthusiasts. It allows users to explore popular travel destinations by entering the city they wish to travel to. The application leverages the power of OpenAI's GPT-3 and DALL-E APIs to provide users with a list of top-rated places to visit and generates an image representing the destination.

## Key Features
1. **Interactive Chat Interface**: Users can input the city they wish to visit, and the application will provide a detailed list of places to visit, along with ratings and brief descriptions.
2. **Dynamic Image Generation**: The application generates an image of the travel destination using OpenAI's DALL-E API, providing a visual representation of the city.
3. **Seamless Animation**: The "Send" button triggers an aeroplane animation, enhancing user experience.
4. **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be user-friendly and responsive across different devices.
